This is a RESTful API developed using Java, Spring Boot, and JDBC for performing CRUD operations on a database also verify for existing user with unique key. The API allows clients to interact with a data model (such as a User, Product, or Employee) and provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete records in a relational database.

Technologies Used:
Java
Spring Boot (for building the REST API)
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity for interacting with the database)
Spring DataSource (for database connection configuration)
H2 Database (or any other relational database of choice)
API Endpoints:
Create: Adds a new record to the database.
---------------------------------------------------------------
How the API Works (Backend Implementation):
1.Controller Layer:
The controller class defines RESTful endpoints using @RestController and @RequestMapping annotations.
Each endpoint method is mapped to the appropriate HTTP method (e.g., @PostMapping, @GetMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping).
The controller invokes service methods to perform CRUD operations.

2.Service Layer:
The service layer contains the business logic and acts as a bridge between the controller and the database layer.
It communicates with the UserRepository (or JdbcTemplate) for performing CRUD operations.

3.Database Configuration:
Database connection is configured using application.properties or application.yml (for Spring Boot).

4.JDBC Template:
Spring's JdbcTemplate is used to handle database interactions, simplifying SQL queries and reducing boilerplate code.

5.Exception Handling:
For improved user experience and debugging, it's essential to handle exceptions gracefully.
Use @ControllerAdvice to handle common exceptions like EntityNotFoundException or SQLException globally.
=================================================
1.Create: Adds a new record to the database.
Endpoint: POST 
Request Body: JSON object representing the entity to be created (e.g., a User object).
Response: The created entity with its database-generated ID
ON POST:
{
    "name": "Sonu",
    "email": "sonu.yadav@example.com",
    "age": 27
}
-----
2.Read: Fetches a list of all records or a specific record based on an ID.

Endpoint: GET /..../.../{entity}/{id} (fetches a specific record by ID)
Endpoint: GET /.../.../{entity} (fetches all records)
Response: JSON array of objects (for GET /api/v1/{entity}) or a single entity (for GET /api/v1/{entity}/{id}).
Example:
[{
    "name": "Sonu",
    "email": "sonu.yadav@example.com",
    "age": 27
}
{
    "name": "Ram",
    "email": "ram.yadav@example.com",
    "age": 27
}]
------
3.Update: Modifies an existing record in the database.
Endpoint: PUT /api/v1/{entity}/{id}
Request Body: JSON object representing the updated entity.
Response: The updated entity.
Example:
On PUT (Updated record got)
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@newdomain.com",
    "age": 31
}
------
4.Delete: Deletes a record by its ID.
Endpoint: DELETE /api/v1/{entity}/{id}
Response: Status message indicating success or failure.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion:
This API enables seamless interaction with a relational database via a set of well-defined RESTful endpoints. It uses JDBC to directly interact with the database for CRUD operations, ensuring a simple, lightweight approach to backend operations. Spring Boot ensures the development is rapid and easy to deploy, with support for various features such as exception handling, database configuration, and data validation.
